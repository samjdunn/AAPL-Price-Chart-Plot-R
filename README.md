# AAPL-Price-Chart-Plot-R
R script that plots the historical price of AAPL
Required Packages = ('quantmod')
The code labled as version 1 is my initial attempt then version 2 is after asking ChatGPT for feedback and ways to improve the script.
Version 1 I deliberately avoided conversing w/ ChatGPT until I had a version I was Happy with, Version 2 I had some help although still could not make the legend overlay (unsure as to why) so have it still in but commented out.
